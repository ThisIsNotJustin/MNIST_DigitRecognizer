# Digit Recognizer

This project is a digit recognizer implemented using a neural network built from scratch without tensorflow (only numpy) and trained on the MNIST dataset. It allows users to draw a digit on a canvas using gradio and predicts the digit drawn using the trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Gradio
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- [MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset)
